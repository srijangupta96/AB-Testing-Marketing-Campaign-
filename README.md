Facebook vs. AdWords Campaign Performance Analysis
Project Overview
This project analyzes and compares the performance of Facebook and Google AdWords advertising campaigns to determine which platform delivers better ROI in terms of clicks, conversions, and cost-effectiveness. The analysis uses a full year of daily campaign data (2019) to provide actionable insights for optimal advertising budget allocation.

Key Findings
Facebook significantly outperforms AdWords in conversions (11.74 vs. 5.98 average daily conversions)

Strong positive correlation on Facebook: 0.87 correlation between clicks and conversions

Moderate correlation on AdWords: 0.45 correlation between clicks and conversions

Mondays and Tuesdays show highest conversion rates

Cointegration test confirms a stable long-term relationship between ad spend and conversions on Facebook

🎯 Executive Summary
This project presents a comprehensive data-driven analysis of a year's worth of digital advertising data from both Facebook and Google AdWords campaigns. The primary goal was to determine the superior platform for maximizing Return on Investment (ROI) by evaluating key performance indicators (KPIs) such as conversions, click-through rates (CTR), and cost-effectiveness.

Conclusion: The analysis provides strong statistical evidence that Facebook advertising was significantly more effective for this specific business context, driving nearly double the conversions at a more efficient cost. Furthermore, the project identifies temporal trends, such as optimal days for conversions, and establishes a predictive model to forecast outcomes based on ad spend.

🎯 Business Problem & Objectives
As a marketing agency, our core mandate is to optimize our clients' advertising budgets for maximum ROI. Faced with limited resources and two major advertising platforms, we needed a definitive answer to guide our strategy.

Primary Research Question: Which platform, Facebook or AdWords, yields a better return on investment in terms of conversions, clicks, and overall cost-effectiveness?

Specific Analytical Objectives:

Perform descriptive statistical analysis to understand baseline performance metrics for both campaigns.

Conduct inferential statistical testing (hypothesis testing) to determine if the difference in conversion rates is statistically significant.

Analyze the correlation between ad clicks and actual sales conversions.

Build a predictive regression model to forecast expected conversions based on advertising clicks.

Investigate temporal patterns (daily, weekly, monthly) to identify seasonality and optimal timing for ad campaigns.

Test for a long-term equilibrium relationship between advertising spend and conversion rates.

📁 Dataset Description
The dataset comprises 365 daily records (Jan 1, 2019 - Dec 31, 2019) for parallel campaigns on Facebook and AdWords.

Key Features for Each Platform:

Ad Views: Number of times the ad was displayed (Impressions)

Ad Clicks: Number of user clicks on the ad

Ad Conversions: Number of desired actions completed (e.g., purchase, sign-up)

Cost per Ad: Total daily spend on the platform

Click-Through Rate (CTR): (Clicks / Views) Percentage of users who clicked after seeing the ad.

Conversion Rate: (Conversions / Clicks) Percentage of users who converted after clicking.

Cost per Click (CPC): (Ad Cost / Clicks) The average cost incurred for each click.

🔬 Methodology & Analytical Approach
The analysis followed a structured, end-to-end data science pipeline:

Data Loading & Cleaning:

Imported data using Pandas and parsed the Date field.

Cleaned numerical fields stored as objects (e.g., $126 -> 126.0, 0.83% -> 0.83).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Used descriptive statistics (describe()) to summarize central tendency and dispersion of key metrics.

Created visualizations (histograms, bar charts, scatter plots) using Matplotlib and Seaborn to understand distributions and relationships.

Statistical Analysis:

Hypothesis Testing: Conducted an independent two-sample T-test to compare the mean daily conversions between Facebook and AdWords.

H₀ (Null Hypothesis): µ_Facebook ≤ µ_AdWords

H₁ (Alternate Hypothesis): µ_Facebook > µ_AdWords

Correlation Analysis: Calculated Pearson correlation coefficients to measure the strength of the linear relationship between Clicks and Conversions for each platform.

Predictive Modeling:

Built a Simple Linear Regression model (using Scikit-learn) to predict Facebook conversions based on the number of clicks.

Evaluated model performance using R² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Time Series Analysis:

Decomposed trends by month and day of the week to identify seasonal patterns.

Performed a Cointegration test (using statsmodels) to check for a long-term equilibrium relationship between daily ad spend and conversions.

💡 Key Findings & Insights
Facebook is the Clear Winner in Driving Conversions:

Mean Daily Conversions: Facebook (11.74) vs. AdWords (5.98). This difference is nearly double.

Hypothesis Test Result: The p-value (9.35e-134) is far below the 0.05 significance level. We reject the null hypothesis, providing statistically significant evidence that Facebook generates more conversions.

Facebook Clicks are Highly Predictive of Sales:

A strong positive correlation (0.87) was found on Facebook, meaning increases in clicks were very likely to lead to increases in conversions.

AdWords showed only a moderate correlation (0.45), indicating its clicks were less reliable predictors of final sales.

Predictive Model for Resource Planning:

The Linear Regression model for Facebook predictions achieved an R² score of 76.35%.

The model allows for precise forecasting: e.g., 50 clicks are predicted to yield ~13 conversions, and 80 clicks are predicted to yield ~19 conversions.

Temporal Insights for Campaign Scheduling:

Days of the Week: Conversions were consistently highest on Mondays and Tuesdays.

Months of the Year: An overall upward trend in conversions was observed throughout the year. Notably, May and November had the lowest Cost per Conversion (CPC), making them the most efficient months for advertising spend.

Long-Term Strategic Relationship Confirmed:

The Cointegration test (p-value: 2.13e-26) confirmed a stable, long-term relationship between advertising spend on Facebook and the conversions it generates. This validates that sustained investment in effective campaigns will reliably yield proportional returns.

📈 Strategic Recommendations
Based on the data, I recommend the following actions to the marketing agency and its clients:

Reallocate Budget Towards Facebook: Shift a significant portion of the advertising budget from AdWords to Facebook to capitalize on its higher conversion volume and efficiency.

Optimize Campaign Scheduling: Concentrate ad launches and budget peaks on Mondays and Tuesdays to leverage higher user intent. Plan major campaign initiatives for May and November to achieve the lowest cost per acquisition.

Leverage the Predictive Model: Use the developed regression model to set realistic daily/weekly conversion goals based on targeted click volumes and to forecast the budget required to hit those goals.

Investigate AdWords Inefficiency: Conduct a deep-dive analysis into the AdWords campaign (e.g., keyword relevance, ad copy, landing page experience) to understand why its clicks do not correlate strongly with conversions and to identify remediation steps.
